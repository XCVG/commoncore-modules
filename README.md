# Extra Modules for CommonCore RPG Libraries for Unity

## Introduction

Extra modules for [CommonCore RPG Library](https://github.com/XCVG/commoncore/). Each folder contains a module that can be added.

## License

Unless otherwise noted, all modules in this repository are dual-licensed under the MIT License (a copy of which is included in LICENSE.txt) and the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (a copy of which is included in ALTLICENSE.txt), with later versions permitted.

It is **strongly** recommended that you license derivatives under the MIT License or dual-license them rather than using the Creative Commons license exclusively. The MIT License is a GPL-compatible permissive software license approved by the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative, while the Creative Commons license is designed for creative works and has several ambiguities when used to license software. The Creative Commons option is provided primarily for compliance with game jams that require entries to be released under such a license.

Some freely-licensed third-party assets are included in the repository. These will be specified in each module and the licenses will be included. In general, all may be reused and distributed under the same conditions as the code even if the specific license differs.
